              Léon is an Italian hitman (or "cleaner", as he refers to himself)
              in the New York City neighborhood of Little Italy working for a
              mafioso named "Old Tony".

              One day, Léon meets Mathilda Lando, a lonely twelve-year-old who
              lives with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hall
              from Léon, and has stopped attending class at her school for
              troubled girls.

              Mathilda's abusive father attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents,
              who have been paying him to stash cocaine in his apartment. After
              they discover he has been stealing the cocaine, DEA agents storm
              the building, led by their boss, the sharply dressed drug addict
              Norman Stansfield.

              During the raid, Stansfield murders Mathilda's family while she is
              out shopping for groceries. When she returns, Mathilda realizes
              what has happened just in time to continue down the hall to Léon's
              apartment; he hesitantly gives her shelter.

              In the chaos, a wounded Léon sneaks out of the building disguised
              as a wounded ESU officer. He goes unnoticed by everyone except
              Stansfield, who follows him and shoots him in the back.

              "Shape of My Heart" is a song by British musician Sting. It was
              released in August 1993 as the fifth single from the album Ten
              Summoner's Tales. The song was co-written by guitarist Dominic
              Miller. It was used for the end credits of the film Léon starring
              Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, and within the 1993
              film Three of Hearts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite failing to reach the top 50 in the UK upon its release, it
              has become a pop classic and one of Sting's works most closely
              associated with his solo career. It currently has more than 220
              million plays on the streaming platform Spotify.
            </p>
            <p>
              Larry Adler played the harmonica section in the song. The song was
              sampled in many songs over the years, most notably on "Shape"
              (2003) by Sugababes, "Rise & Fall" (2003) by Craig David, The
              Message (1996) by Nas, and also Sting himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The song's guitar riff was also interpolated by Juice WRLD on the
              worldwide hit "Lucid Dreams" (2018) and on "You’re Mines Still"
              (2020) by rapper BLEU.

              Leon the Professional remains one of the best crime movies ever
              made. Here's what you never knew about the making of this odd
              couple movie. The original ending of Leon was conceived to be far
              darker than what transpires in the released version. Rather than
              planting Leon's favorite shrub outside the orphanage to honor his
              memory and start a new life, Mathilda goes murderously insane.

            The plot centers on Léon (Reno), a professional hitman who
            reluctantly takes in twelve-year-old Mathilda Lando (Portman) after
            her family is murdered by corrupt Drug Enforcement Administration
            agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Léon and Mathilda form an unusual
            relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the hitman's
            trade.
